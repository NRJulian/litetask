This file contains patches to compile GNU make v3.58 with
Microsoft C 6.0 for MS-DOS.
     
To compile this program, you also need the complete GNU make sources for
version 3.58.  These patches are for MSC v6.0, other compilers surely need
some more work!
     
Copy this file and your GNU make v3.58 sources into a new directory,
cd to it, and say
     
        rm makefile
        patch < patches1
	patch < patches2
        make
     
That's all.
     
Please note that these patches (although distributed under the GNU General
Public License) do NOT belong to the official GNU make distribution.
     
Of course the MS-DOS Version of GNU make comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
     
You can reach me at <td12@ddagsi3.bitnet> for bug reports, etc. (but no
promises).
     
Enjoy it!

NOTES FOR THE SECOND SET OF PATCHES
-----------------------------------

These are the patches (w.r.t. the version which is already patched for
MSDOS, i.e. patches for patches) for compiling GNU make with the new
`swaplib'.

      * spawn.c is superceedes by swaplibl.lib.
      * swap.c is make obsolete by the new swap.c distributed with `swaplib'.

      * the `-x' commandline switch has gone away.
	use SWAPPING={xms,ems,disk} (either on the commandline or in the
	makefile) instead.

      * most important change:
	you can now really interrupt a compilation!
	The old make had the annoying "feature" that it responded to a
	SIGINT by asking you to be patient and leaving the child alone.
	(This was so because I was overly cautious about signals.)
	Now the SIGINT is passed to the child  (via the standard
	"stc; retf" mechanism) and a compilation will be interrupted
	(during the next console I/O.

      * `swaplib' corrects a few minor bugs of spawn.c in the respondfile
	generation.  It should also provide better hooks for your own
	respondfiles.

      * EMS is now supported (not not tested extensively).

      * The version message claims now that this is a "beta" version,
	as there have been no bug reports.

Enjoy

For those of you who are interested: here's an excerpt from
my `todo' file:

      * enable the non-swapping mode

      * zipscan.c: code ar_member_touch() (needs reversed dos_time() and
	handling of the global directory)

      * better support for short MS-DOS filenames ("gnumakefile" should
	match "gnumakef", etc.), also take care of MS-DOS'
	case-insensitivity

      * replace default_include_directories by $INCLUDE
